# Changelog
All notable changes to this project should be documented in this file. The intention is to [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).


## 0.1.0 - 2018-04-02

### Added
- A (very basic) interpreter for Schem, which is yet another Lisp dialect with a punny name.  
Credit goes to [Joel Martin's](https://github.com/kanaka) awesome [Make a Lisp](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md) guide and [Masahiro Wakame's](https://github.com/vvakame) TypeScript implementation of Mal.
- A sufficiently green-on-black Schem REPL page.
- Unit testing support, tanks to [ghiermann](https://github.com/ghiermann).
- This file, in celebration of Golem's first baby step on the way to synthetic consciousness.

## 0.0.x - 2018-03-xx
### What happened before
- Used [mazamachi's](https://github.com/mazamachi) Yeoman [generator for chrome extensions written in TypeScript](https://github.com/mazamachi/generator-chrome-extension-kickstart-typescript) to scaffold out this project.
- Some css/javascript injection tests, much hair pulling.
- Trying to get a grip on typescript, lisp, writing your own lisp in typescript, webextensions, gulp, all those es6 features that look cool, the node.js ecosystem, ~~npm~~ yarn... (ongoing)
